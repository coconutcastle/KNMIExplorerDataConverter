When you're here, save the page as a text file with a .txt file extension. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting "Save As...". If this doesn't work, you can just copy the entire page into a new text file and save it like that.

Upload the file with the "Choose File" button, and the file contents will be displayed below. You can check if you've uploaded the correct file here. When you're ready, click "Convert", and the .csv file will be automatically downloaded. 

Rename the file to whatever you want (ideally something useful), and open in Microsoft Excel, upload to Google Sheets, or any other program that opens .csv files! From there, you'll (hopefully) be able to use lots of handy built-in analytical tools. Note: For whatever program you're using to open or import it, make sure that you have "comma" selected as the delimiter. The data may be formated very weirdly otherwise.

Happy data analysis!
